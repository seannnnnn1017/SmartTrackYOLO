# SmartTrackYOLO
 YOLOTrack is an efficient object tracking algorithm based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series. This project aims to enhance the frame rate of high-resolution videos by employing a region-marking strategy. After detecting the object in the first frame, the subsequent frames only process a specific area around the previous frame's object location, thereby reducing the computational load.

## Features
High Efficiency: Reduces computation by limiting the detection area in subsequent frames.
Real-Time Tracking: Maintains high frame rates even with high-resolution videos.
Easy Integration: Simple and straightforward integration with existing YOLO models.
Dynamic Search Area: Automatically adjusts the search area based on the object's movement.
## Installation
